    <h1>My Japan Trip</h1>
    
    <p>
        During my trip to Japan, I visited several amazing places. Here are some of my favorite memories!
    </p>

    <h2>Tokyo Disneyland</h2>
    <p>
        Tokyo Disneyland not only had a bunch of fun rides but also good food/snacks! 
        Some of my favorite includes the Toy Story mochi with chocolate, custard, and strawberry flavors as well as the super cute BayMax Curry!
        One of the things I've realized is that Japan loves to make their food cute but also deliciious!
        I would also recomment the turkey or chicken leg in Disneysea as well!

    <h2>Kyoto Matcha Experience</h2>
    <p>
        Kyoto was my favorite area to explore the scenary as well as enjoy some good matcha!
        Here I was able to take pictures in Kimono, drink matcha latte, and eat matcha icecream!
        One of the must try things here was the matcha ramen which is controversial because I had different opnions of both.
        Try and let me know how it tastes!

    <h2>Osaka Night Markets</h2>
    <p>
        In Osaka, the night life is great. There are a lot of stores and restuarants open at night.
        It was super lively!
        Among my favorite is to go to arcades such as Round1.
        They usually have multiple stores of arcade so you won't leave their anytime soon.
        Just make sure to bring ton of cash!

    <h2>Ao Island (Cat Island)</h2>
    <p>
        Lastly, it was one of my personal favorites: Cat Island!
        As a cat lover, I couldn't miss the chance to be in a island full of cats!
        I stayed 8 hours on the island with cats surrounding me and I have to say it was the best experience ever!
        I really enjoyed every minute with them and I would love to go back anotehr time if I could!
