        <p>
            Hello! My name Julia, a sophomore at studying Data Science and Finance at Northeastern University!
            I'm orginally from the Bay Area, California. This summer I went to Japan for a month for vacation and it was one of the best experiences of my life!
            Throughout my trip in Japan, I visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, and Shikoku Island.
            They were all amazing and unforgettable experiences. 
            Therefore, I am very excited to share my journey as well as some recommendation spots on this website!
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                One of my highlights of Tokyo was visiting Tokyo Disneyland. 
                Even as an average Disney show watcher, I found Disneyland to be a fascinating experience.
                The architecture and food was amazing and I would totally recommend. 
                I loved all the rides there. However, if you are going espically during busy times, definetly invest in a express pass. 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                Shortly after Tokyo was Kyoto and Kyoto was known for more of the traditional temples.
                It was interesting seeing all the temples and shrines as well as take pictures in a kimono!
                To everyone who is interested in taking pictures or leaving memories, I would definetly recommend renting kimonos.
                It is reasonable price and there are so many options. 
                Some even come with doing your hair and makeup!
                Other than that, I would say the matcha at Kyoto is to die for. 
                In the Gion district, there is so many matcha and tradiitonal confectionary places that are amazing!

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                Lastly, Osaka! Osaka was a major hub for incredible food and night markets. I remember the okonomiyaki and takoyaki was to die for.
                In additon, shopping at Don Quijote was unlike the other cities. 
                In the Dotonburi district, there was at least 7 floors os hopping and ferris wheel you can go on to see the river and city view.
                Overall, I think Osaka is a great place to hang around especially at night in arcades!
