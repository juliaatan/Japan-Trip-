        <p>
            Hello! My name Julia, a sophomore at studying Data Science and Finance at Northeastern University!
            I'm originally from the Bay Area, California. This summer I went to Japan for a month for vacation and it was one of the best experiences of my life!
            Throughout my trip in Japan, I visited Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, and Shikoku Island.
            They were all amazing and unforgettable experiences. 
            Therefore, I am very excited to share my journey as well as some recommendation spots on this website!
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            One of my highlights of Tokyo was visiting Tokyo Disneyland. 
            Even as an average Disney show watcher, I found Disneyland to be a fascinating experience.
            The architecture and food were amazing and I would totally recommend it. 
            I loved all the rides there. However, if you are going especially during busy times, definitely invest in an express pass. 
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            Shortly after Tokyo was Kyoto, known for its traditional temples.
            It was interesting seeing all the temples and shrines as well as taking pictures in a kimono!
            To everyone who is interested in taking pictures or leaving memories, I would definitely recommend renting kimonos.
            The prices are reasonable and there are so many options. 
            Some even come with hairstyling and makeup!
            Other than that, the matcha in Kyoto is to die for. 
            In the Gion district, there are so many matcha and traditional confectionary places that are amazing!

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            Lastly, Osaka! Osaka was a major hub for incredible food and night markets. I remember the okonomiyaki and takoyaki were to die for.
            In addition, shopping at Don Quijote was unlike the other cities. 
            In the Dotonbori district, there was at least 7 floors of shopping and a Ferris wheel you can ride to see the river and city view.
            Overall, I think Osaka is a great place to hang around, especially at night in the arcades!
